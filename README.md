=========

This is a little script to find doctor status in the Apss Trentino website [apss](http://www.apss.tn.it/public/ddw.aspx?n=47473).

The problem was: we were waiting for an specific doctor because it was recommended by our friends, but he has no more place for new patients. We don't want to search it in the website everyday.
The solution: i created this script :).

And now, after a few days, we have the desired doctor!
